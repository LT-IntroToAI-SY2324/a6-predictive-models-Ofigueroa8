# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
The r squared value was 0.6257932855322312. This means that the comparisons between blood pressure and age aren't the biggest determinents or factors. They are related, but not to such a big extent.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
Someone who is 43 years old has a predicted blood pressure of 137.46185286.

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
The model's predictions don't seem too great in my opinion. I don't think that the predictions are accurate enough as, of course, there are many factors that go into blood pressure, but the data seems too scattered to truly have an accurate prediction. A way to improve the model could definitely be through having way more data to have a better line of best fit which would result in better predictions.
