# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
The bottom left group shall be called the "Cursed" as they have little to no income and spend very little probably due to society and (mostly) the government neglecting them. The bottom right group would be called the "Hoarders" cause they have a decent amount of money but don't want to use it on spending. The middle group are called the "Healthy Normies" because they have some income and still don't spend an excessive amount compared to the other groups. The top left group will be called the "Impulsive" as they don't have very much income but spend a lot of their money without much consideration for the future. The top right group shall be called "Royalty" because they have the most amount of money and spend the most just like a rich royal person would.

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
The hoarders would be medium income and low spending habits.

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
The cluster of choice are the Impulsive ones. A marketing team wouldn't need to try that hard to approach this specific group as even though they have a lower income than the rest of the groups, they still spend their money just as much as the Royalty group. If the marketing team does a decent job at just presenting a product that isn't completely useless, the Impulsive group would probably buy it.
