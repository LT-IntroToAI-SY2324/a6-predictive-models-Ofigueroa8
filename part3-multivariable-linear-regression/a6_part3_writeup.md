# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
The r squared coefficient I got for my model was 0.86. This indicates that the factors are quite impactful or have a good correlation with the price.

2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
I would definitely say the model is accurate. After running the program a couple times I was consistently getting r squared values either equal to or greater than 0.85. Because there is more than one factor involved it makes the prediction better suited.

3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
For a model that is 10 years old with 89000 miles it would be worth 8995.08 and for a model that is 20 years old with 15000 miles it would be worth 1598.2.

4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
The negative numbers are probably due to the actual value of the car being less valuable. It's similar to a newer car being much more valuable and more expensive than a used and older model. Depreciation is a better word as to why some results are negative.
